# Datawarehouse SQL query examples

sql-examples folder contains few sample queries for WYDOT data files. This also includes geospatial query samples.

The queries are in HiveQL variation of SQL, which is specific to Hive/Hadoop datawarehouse installation. While generally compatible, there might be some variations from regular SQL. Consult HiveQL documentation for differences if you run into some incompatibilities.

Examples are given only for WYOMING datasets, but similar queries may also be used for NYCDOT or THEA data.
