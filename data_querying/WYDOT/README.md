# Datawarehouse SQL query examples

sql-examples folder contains few sample queries for WYDOT data files. This also includes geospatial query samples.

The queries are in HiveQL variation of SQL, which is specific to Hive/Hadoop datawarehouse installation. While generally compatible, there might be some variations from regular SQL. Consult HiveQL documentation for differences if you run into some incompatibilities.
